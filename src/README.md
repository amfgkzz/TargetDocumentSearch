## Thoughts

    I think that this was a very challenging task, and it was something I haven't attempted before. When I was running the tests, it took a very long time for the program to finish the search queries. I don't think this code is production ready at all, it still needs more tests, needs to go through some kind of QA. While I do think that better hardware would help improve the time on the tests, I believe that writing better and more efficient code would improve the speed much more dramatically. I think that if I had more knowledge on designs and patterns I could implement a better method using algorithms. Before writing this code, I've only heard about binary searches and index searches, never seen any code like it or implemented anything similar before. This was a very humbling experience for me. It's something I would love to try again in the future.
